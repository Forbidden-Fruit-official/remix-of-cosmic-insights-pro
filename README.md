# Remix of Cosmic Insights Pro

PROJECT NAME:

Cosmic Blueprint

MISSION

Build a production-grade astrology platform called Cosmic Blueprint capable of generating the most comprehensive and accurate astrological reports possible.

This is not a simple astrology website.

This is a professional astrology intelligence platform capable of generating detailed premium reports based entirely on real astronomical calculations.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. AI MUST NEVER guess, simulate, estimate, invent, approximate, hallucinate, or fabricate planetary positions.

2. All chart calculations must come from Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph).

3. Tropical Zodiac.

4. Placidus House System.

5. Geocentric Western Astrology.

6. Automatic timezone resolution.

7. Automatic birthplace geocoding.

8. Automatic daylight savings handling.

9. If Swiss Ephemeris is unavailable, calculations must fail and display an error instead of generating fake data.

10. Every chart calculation must display:

   - Calculation engine

   - Timestamp

   - Version information

11. FreeAstro or other APIs may only be used for comparison and validation.

   They may never replace Swiss Ephemeris as the source of truth.

12. All reports must be generated from actual chart data returned by Swiss Ephemeris.

13. System must support future expansion.
